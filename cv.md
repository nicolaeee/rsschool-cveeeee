## To be short:
At the moment I'm just a student in Romania but speaking about myself I'm from Moldova, here I'm studying Computer Sience, and I'm taking this course just to explore something new.

Why front-end?
-Well, why not if it is free and I have enough free time for reaching stars here(joke), I'm 19 years old, not old enough but still, I really want to take this course in a serios way and I hope that I'd do it.

I believe in myself that I could do it, I'd end this markdown today.

	cout << "Number of lines: "; cin >> m;
	cout << "Number of culumns: "; cin >> n;
	for(i=0;i<m;i++)
		for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
			cout << "A[" << i << "'" << j << "]";
			cin >> A[i][j];
		}
	//showing array
	for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		for (j = 0; j < n; j++)
			cout << A[i][j] << "\t";
		cout << "\n";
